# Neural-Networks
Throughout the 4 layers we selected for the neural network model, three of them were had an accuracy rate of 68% and the 4th model was at 46%. We chose 4 different layers because the original model was not going past 70% accuracy rate after adding the features and variables. We were not able to achieve the target model performance although we did try multiple models to try to achieve the target model. Personally, I would not use a different model because this is the most accurate model that can be used for this type of data.
